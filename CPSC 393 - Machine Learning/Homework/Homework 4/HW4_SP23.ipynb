        "1. Choose a book or other text to train your model on (I suggest [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/) to find .txt files but you can find them elsewhere). Make sure your file is a `.txt` file. Clean your data (You may use [this file](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1HCgKn5XQ7Q3ywxGszVWx2kddfT9UBASp?usp=sharing) we talked about in class as a baseline). Build a sequential model (LSTM, GRU, SimpleRNN, or Transformer) that generates new lines based on the training data (NO TRANSFER LEARNING).\n",
        "\n",
        "Print out or write 10 generated sequences from your model (Similar to Classwork 17 where we generated new Pride and Prejudice lines, but now with words instead of charachters. Feel free to use [this](https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-develop-a-word-level-neural-language-model-in-keras/) as a reference). Assess in detail how good they are, what they're good at, what they struggle to do well. \n",
        "\n",
        "2. Make a new model with ONE substantial adjustment (e.g. use a custom embedding layer if you didn't already, use a pre-trained embedding layer if you didn't already, use a DEEP LSTM/GRU with multiple recurrent layers, use a pre-trained model to do transfer learning and fine-tune it...etc.). \n",

Assess in detail how good they are, what they're good at, what they struggle to do well.  Did the performance of your model change?\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Then create a **technical report** discussing your model building process, the results, and your reflection on it. The report should follow the format in the example including an Introduction, Analysis, Methods, Results, and Reflection section."
