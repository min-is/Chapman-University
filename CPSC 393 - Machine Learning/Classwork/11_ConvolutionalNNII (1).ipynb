    "[Depthwise Separable Convolutions](https://keras.io/api/layers/convolution_layers/separable_convolution2d/) are a way to reduce the computational cost of performing a convolution. DSC's apply a filter to each channel in an input image *separately* and then convolve those outputs together. This does assume that the different channels in the input are highly independent, but that's often true so it typically won't reduce the performance of your model unless that assumption is violated.\n",
