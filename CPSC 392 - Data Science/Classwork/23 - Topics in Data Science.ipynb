        "# 1. The Ensemble\n",
        "A common theme in applied Machine Learning is *The Ensemble Method*. Ensemble methods use multiple machine learning models (these models can be the same type or different algorithms entirely). The idea is that using ensembles improves predictive performance, because even though our models are sometimes incorrect, it's unlikely that a MAJORITY of the models in our ensemble will all be incorrect in the exact same way each time. Therefore in aggregate, we will get a more accurate model.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each model gets a \"vote\" about what category a data point should be in (ensemble methods also work for continuous outcomes, but here we'll focus on categorical ones). Whichever category gets the most \"votes\" is the category we choose for that data point. \n",
        "\n",
        "To combat overfitting and reduce potential *over-reliance* on a small number of features, we can use the two following techniques when creating models for our ensemble:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)**: Instead of using all of our training data to train each model in our sample we use **bootstrapping** to choose the samples we will include.\n",
        "    * **Bootstrapping** is when you randomly sample data points *with replacement*, meaning that a data point can be included in your bootstrapped sample *more* than once, OR not at all.\n",
